complaints in Chicago. Journal of Urban Ecology. doi: 10.1093/jue/juab006


**This repository has 5 R scripts used for this analysis:** The first three scripts 
load and clean multiple datasets on rat complaints and possible 
environmental and social correlates. The raw data are not uploaded, because 
they are publicly available elsewhere. However, the cleaned datasets generated
by these scripts are provided in the DataCleaned folder. The 4th and 5th scripts 
run the models and create the figures in the paper. If you do not wish to run
the models, their outputs are also uploaded in the ModelOutput folder.
